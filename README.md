This is a follow up app to the docker-rails-school app with all of the files
associated with Docker and docker-compose.

In order for this app to work in development you will need to change the gmail
credentials in the .env file in the root directory.

Full instructions for configuring the app can be found in this [blog post](www.coshx.com/blog/2016/08/23/configuring-docker-to-work-with-an-existing-rails-application/)
